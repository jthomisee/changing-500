Do I need pagination for the games list at some point?

Where else do I need pagination?

Make side bets user configurable

The search for public groups is broken

User management search is broken

Edit users notification preferences when editing user in admin panel

The admin page on mobile cuts off all of the date, maybe it should just show names until you click on a user

When you are not a member of any group, the dashboard button should say Create or Join a Group and take you to https://changing500.com/groups?tab=join

Dont even show the Create group button in the top right if you arent in a group

Getting error when joining a public group
Error: Cannot find module 'joinGroup'

If you arent logged in, dont show anything other than the Dashboard page in the nav

When switching pages if it should start me at the top of the page, currently it keeps me scrolled to the position I was in on the previous page.

When selecting Create a New group from the group switcher, its missing the public option checkbox. Shouldnt this be shared code?

If there are no scheduled games, lets say something like "Sorry, there are no upcoming scheduled games in this group" on the schedule page

Instead of having a manage tab for games, lets move the add new game to the schedule tab (Only shown if you are an admin or group owner) and move the Edit/Send Results/Delete functions to the history tab (again only if you are an admin or owner should these be shown)
