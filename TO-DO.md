Do I need pagination for the games list at some point?

Where else do I need pagination?

Make side bets user configurable

The search for public groups is broken

User management search is broken

Edit users notification preferences when editing user in admin panel

The admin page on mobile cuts off all of the date, maybe it should just show names until you click on a user

When you are not a member of any group, the dashboard button should say Create or Join a Group and take you to https://changing500.com/groups?tab=join

Dont even show the Create group button in the top right if you arent in a group

Getting error when joining a public group
Error: Cannot find module 'joinGroup'

If you arent logged in, dont show anything other than the Dashboard page in the nav
